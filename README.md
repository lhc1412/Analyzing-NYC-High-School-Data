# Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data
In this project, I am going to explore relationships between SAT scores and demographic factors in New York City public schools. The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. The SAT has three sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school. In this project, the following data sets will be used.

- SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
- School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City
- Class size - Information on class size for each school
- AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an - - - optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
- Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
- Demographics - Demographic information for each school
- School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

### Summary of results
After analysing the data, the following findings are found:
- Shools with higher SAT score trend to respond to the survey.
- The safer and respective teacher and student feel, the highr SAT score they get.
- The more engaged the student is, better results he/she gets.
- Students have the ability to predecit the results they are going to get. but the parents and teachers do not.
- The precentage of white student and asian student have strong positive correlations with the sat scores. 
- The precentage of black student and hispanic student have negative correlation relationship with the sat scores.
